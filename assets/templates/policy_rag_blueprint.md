# Policy RAG Blueprint

Purpose: Deploy a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant over policies, product docs, and disclosures.

## 1. Scope & Corpus
- In-scope documents (owners, locations):
- Update cadence & ingestion process:
- Redaction & access constraints:

## 2. Retrieval Design
- Chunking strategy (size, overlap):
- Embeddings (model, dim):
- Index (vector store) & metadata schema:
- Relevance evaluation (metrics, sample set):

## 3. Prompting & Guardrails
- System prompt (purpose and tone):
- Few-shot exemplars:
- Safety filters and refusal rules:
- Hallucination checks (self-eval, citations):

## 4. Integration & Ops
- UI touchpoints (chat, API, plugin):
- AuthN/Z and audit logs:
- Monitoring (latency, answer quality):
- Feedback loops and continuous improvement:

## 5. Governance
- Model card and approvals:
- Change management:
- Incident response and rollback:
